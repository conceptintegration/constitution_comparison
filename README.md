# Constitution Comparison

Constitution comparison notebook for:

1. Semantic alignment of pairs of constitutions by integrating under segment similarity PDFs generated by KDE.
2. Comparing distributions of segment counts over topics.

Semantic alignment is an estimation of the semantic similarity of two populations of text segments from different constitutions. Measures of semantic alignment are based on the observed distributions of semantic similarity scores. For example, to measure the alignment of two constitutions, a similarity matrix is pre-compiled with the segments of one constitution in rows and the segments of the other constitution in columns. The observed distribution is generated by calculating the frequency of segment pairs for a range of semantic similarity values, for example, the highest similarity value from each row and column of the matrix.

We apply kernel density estimation (KDE) to observed distributions. KDE is a non-parametric method used to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of observed data (Silverman, B.W., 1986). Using integration, we determine the area under a PDF $p$ within a similarity score interval $I$ with limits $[a,1.0]$. The area $p$ is the probability that a similarity score $x$ is in the interval and is our measure of semantic alignment $A$.

## Requirements

A Python installation capable of running Jupyter notebooks, for example, Anaconda.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo to a suitable location on your local machine.
2. Open `installer.ipynb` and run the installation cell to install the `data` and `model` directories. This only needs to be done once.
3. Open `constitution_comparison.ipynb` and run the cells in order.
